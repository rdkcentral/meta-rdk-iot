Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Patch out visibility restriction

For some reason, the SDK put in a gn restriction for the required-privileges
source_set that prevents any gn from using it either directly or transitively
unless it falls under the set of paths listed. Because we build barton matter
with the SDK as a subdirectory, the barton matter gn is never in the visibility
scope. After checking history, it's not remotely clear why this restriction was
added or if there is supposed to be some alternative (since it's a deep
transitive dependency). This commit simply comments out the visibility restriction
so we can still build.
